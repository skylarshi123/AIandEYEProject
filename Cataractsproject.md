**Project Essentials:**
- Define project scope and objectives.
- Set a clear deadline for the end of the quarter.

**Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
- Gather a dataset of eye images suitable for training the AI model.
- Preprocess the dataset, including data augmentation if needed.
- Label the dataset for cataracts detection.

**Model Development:**
- Choose a suitable deep learning framework (e.g., PyTorch).
- Develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for cataracts detection.
- Train the model using the prepared dataset.

**Model Evaluation:**
- Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score).
- Fine-tune the model if necessary to improve its performance.

**Documentation and Knowledge Sharing:**
- Document the model architecture, training process, and evaluation results.
- Share knowledge within the team by referring to relevant educational resources (e.g., Aditya's PyTorch curriculum).

**Team Training:**
- Ensure that all team members gain hands-on experience in machine learning.
- Encourage team members to refer to research papers related to cataracts detection.

**Integration with iOS App (Optional):**
- If time permits, prepare the model for integration into the iOS app.

**Integration with iOS App (Optional):**
- Tasks right now: Learn from Aditya's resources and get data!

-This will be a more complete plan:
